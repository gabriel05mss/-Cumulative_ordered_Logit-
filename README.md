# Cumulative_ordered_Logit

Ordered regression for an outcome $y\$ $\in$ $\{(1, \ldots, K\)}\$ with predictors $x_n\$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^D\$ is determined by a single coefficient vector $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^D\$ along with a sequence of cutpoints $c_i \in \mathbb{R}^{K-1}\$ sorted so that $c_i < c_{i+1}\$. The discrete output occurs if the linear predictor $x_n\beta\$ falls between $c_i\$ and $c_{i+1}\$, assuming $c_0 = -\infty\$ and $c_K = +\infty\$. The noise term is fixed by the form of regression, with examples for ordered logit and ordered probit models.
